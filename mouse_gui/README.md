🧠 Required Setup
🔑 1. API Keys

You’ll need:

    OpenAI API key

    ElevenLabs API key

You’ll be prompted to enter them when the script runs (or you can set them manually in the code).
✏️ 2. Customize the System Prompt and Gui title

Look for this line of code in the mouse_gui.py script to change the Gui title
       root.title("Voice Chat with Ada")
And change it to whatever you want it to say       


Open the Python script (e.g., mouse_gui.py) and locate the system prompt section. Update the placeholder lines like:

"user": "your name",
"assistant": "AI's name",

👉 NOTE: Be sure to fill in both fields with custom names and no quotes around the names or blank lines to avoid syntax errors. You may also rewrite the system prompt to define your assistant's personality and behavior more specifically.
🧪 Running the Assistant

After installation:

cd ada_mouse_only
python ada_mouse_only.py

Speak clearly when the GUI activates. Click the Push-to-Talk button to send your voice input.
